### Our tangled family tree: new genomic methods offer insight into the legacy of archaic admixture 
This is additional data for my review paper on archaic admixture. It includes information I compiled on functional archaic introgression from papers published 2014 - 2020.

Functional Archaic Introgression Papers (2014-2020).csv: Extended table with more genes and SNPs plus information on methods and statistics used to infer archaic introgression and/or function.
